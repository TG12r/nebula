**Music. Open. Beautiful.**

Nebula is an open-source music streaming application designed for those who appreciate privacy and aesthetics as much as audio. Built with **Flutter** and **Supabase**, inspired by the industrial design language of CMF.

### Why Nebula?
*   **Zero Ads, Zero Cost:** Open source forever.
*   **Stunning UI:** Monochrome, dot-matrix typography, and fluid animations.
*   **Community Warning:** This isn't just an app; it's a movement against closed ecosystems.
